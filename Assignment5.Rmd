#Business Forecasting Assignment 5 - Decomposition - Aarthi Prakash

#Creating Time series from data points

#Import Updated Data

#Decomposition Commands
#stl_decomp Takes 2 Arguments
?stl
stl_decomp <- stl(HospitalRevenue_ts,s.window ="periodic")
#needs time series for decomposition, s.window is either periodic or has to be odd and >7
#Generally use periodic always

# Table View
stl_decomp
#Prints a lot of data - seasonality, trend, remainder = C + I together
attributes(stl_decomp) #see other values this stores - 
stl_decomp$time.series
stl_decomp$weights

# Graph View
plot(stl_decomp)
#How to read graph
#Find the highest and lowest in trend - 15000 to 30000 - trend is upwards and very similar to the data

#Print out a seasonal adjustment
tmp <- seasadj(stl_decomp)
# shows seasonally adjusted data
plot(tmp) #plots seasonaly adjusted data

# Plot a line on the graph
plot(HospitalRevenue_ts)
lines(seasadj(stl_decomp), col = 'purple')

plot(HospitalRevenue_ts)
lines(tmp, col = 'purple')    
#When plotting the original time series and the seasonally adjusted line - they are very similar

#Forecast with the seasonally adjusted data
#Default period forecast
f_stl <- forecast(stl_decomp)

# you can pass the # of period - 15 months
f_stl <- forecast(stl_decomp,h=12)

#Print it out or graph it
f_stl
plot(f_stl)
#plot is synthesizing using the components - starts looking like the historical data itself
accuracy(f_stl) #MAPE is 1.523904 which seems pretty good

#Residual analysis for forecast
Acf(f_stl$residuals) #Removes the lag 0 which has the original data and will always be 1
acf(f_stl$residuals)
tmp <- Acf(f_stl$residuals)
tmp

#Shows that there is something non-random happening in M3, M4, M6
f_stl$method
#"STL +  ETS(M,A,N)" 

#Plot original time series and what decomposition predicted
plot(HospitalRevenue_ts)
lines(f_stl$fitted, col = 'Red') 
accuracy(f_stl) #MAPE is low at 1.523904

#decomposition through stl function uses Loess function


#Another way to run decomposition model#
# There is more than one way to do things
decomp_elec <- decompose(HospitalRevenue_ts) #Underlying math is different from stl function
attributes(decomp_elec)
decomp_elec

?decompose
decomp_elec$figure

plot(stl_decomp)
plot(decomp_elec) #Plot is little different from stl function

seasadj(decomp_elec)
#f_decomp <- forecast(decomp_elec,h=12) #Won't work - forecast only takes the stl component
f_decomp <- forecast(seasadj(decomp_elec),h=12) #BUT can forecast seasonally adjusted (but takes seasonality out)

plot(HospitalRevenue_ts)
lines(f_decomp$fitted,col = 'purple')

accuracy(f_decomp) #MAPE = 1.550416
accuracy(f_stl) #MAPE = 1.523904
#stl is better than decompositon - according to help it tells that the stl function is more sophisticated than decomposition function


#HW - run on own data
#if data doesn't have seasonality you may get an error because data doesn't have seasonality
#Provide proof that there is no seasonality in data if that is true

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
